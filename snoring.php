            <strong>Is it fair?</strong> Your partner snores through the night, and has a fairly good nights sleep, while you keep waking up because of their snoring? Of course that isn’t fair! Then the next day, they say they had a good nights sleep, and you’re feeling like you’ve been awake for ever!!
            <br />
            <br />
            Snoring affects the quality of sleep, and as studies show, it generally isn’t the person snoring who suffers, it’s the person next to them who unfortunately wakes up tired! Is it now time for you to solve that?

It’s a lovely smell and creates a calming relaxed environment to promote sleep. I found it really helpful especially as it doesn’t leave you feeling sluggish in the morning or affect you so much you couldn’t respond to the needs of children overnight. Highly recommended, excellent value and fantastic customer service.”

              Hello Sandra, thank you for taking the time to email in those great comments for the Sleep Better Pillow Mist and it’s brilliant news that it’s helping your daughter to sleep better. Getting a good nights sleep is so important, but for growing children, this is when it’s critical, children only grow when they’re asleep, and if they don’t get as much sleep as other children, they will be at a disadvantage because of that.

              Hi Sim, thank you so much for this great feedback, it’s really appreciated. Yes, it does have many uses, apart from the main idea of lightly misting it on your pillow to help you sleep at night, you can also use it as a room spray, in your bath water, it also helps to keep mosquitoes away! Going by the many emails we receive on this, some people buy the Sleep Better Pillow Mist and spray around their lounge to help them relax in the evening after a hard days work!
