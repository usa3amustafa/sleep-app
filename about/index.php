          <p class="about-text-section-desc grid-two-col-desc">
            <strong>January 2014-January 2016,</strong> after watching a television programme about how 1 in 3 people suffer from sleeping issues, which sometimes led to depression, irritability, difficulty concentrating, etc, we thought that something should be done to help people to sleep better, and then underwent intensive research into sleep issues and more importantly, the sleep solutions.
            <br />
            <br />
            <strong>January 2016-January 2018,</strong> on concluding the above research, and realizing that people are tending to go the more natural route for solving things nowadays, rather than take sleeping tablets or sleeping pills, and never really knowing what they’re doing to your internal organs, we started experimenting with natural, organic essential oils (17 of them!)  We kept trialing different variations of essential oils, this was the most expensive part – good quality essential oils are never cheap!
            <br />
            <br />
            <strong>January 2018,</strong> we had the finished, proven product, which is now helping people world-wide.
