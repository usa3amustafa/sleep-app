            Do you sometimes find it hard to go to sleep? Do you wake up during the night?
            <br /><br />
            On average, you need at least 8 hours sleep a night in order to function well during the next day, but a high percentage of people very rarely get more than 5 hours sleep a night.
            <br /><br />
            If you don’t sleep properly, the following can happen to you: memory problems, tiredness, dizziness, headaches, depression, irritability, diabetes, unable to concentrate, weight gain. Do any of these ring a bell with you?
            <br /><br />
            There can be many reasons for not sleeping well, including insomnia, snoring and fibromyalgia, these are the usual reasons, BUT, the solutions to sleeping issues don’t need to be the ‘usual’! Many people world-wide are realising that there’s now a more natural, more successful way than taking sleeping tablets and other pills.
            <br /><br />
            The Sleep Better Pillow Mist seen here is helping many people world-wide to sleep better.  Is it now time that it helped you as well?

            “I couldn’t recommend this product more highly (and I’m difficult to please!) Left to my own devices, I’d have been quite cynical about this sort of product and I do not expect I would have purchased it. Fortunately for me, my husband bought me this for Christmas as I have had difficulty getting some quality, unbroken sleep. I can honestly say that it has made a HUGE difference. The quality of my sleep is now vastly improved and I use this routinely. The smell is lovely and I now associate it with getting a great night’s sleep. I will certainly be a returning customer.”

It has always impacted his sleep, he barely got 4 hours a night and nothing we tried was any help until we were told about this sleep better pillow mist, my son has now been using it for over a year now and he gets the best nights sleep he’s ever had, every night and if he forgets to spray his pillow and wakes up in the night, he just sprays (it doesn’t stain) onto his pillow and he’s back off to sleep again. I would recommend this to anyone that struggles with sleep, it’s an amazing product.”

The smell is stronger than other ones that we have used but creates a great aura before bed. We used it for my 5 year old and 2 year old and their sleep, especially during lockdown in the UK, has improved since using this product. The bottle will last us for ages which is great!

My brother-in-law introduced me to this sleep better pillow mist, all I can say is, what an amazing product it is! From the very first night on using this mist, he hardly snored at all and has hardly snored at all since. We had a meal out a few days ago to celebrate!!

From the many emails received here at Sleep Better Pillow Mist HQ, this seems to be a recurring problem, with comments such as “My partner snores, how can I stop them from snoring” or “How can I sleep when my partner snores?” All we can say to those that are still not sure, is just try it!
