            The menopause is the time that marks the end of menstrual cycles. It‚Äôs diagnosed after 12 months have gone without a menstrual period. Menopause usually happens between the age of 40 to 60, with the average age of having menopause symptoms being 50.
            <br />
            <br />
            The menopause is a natural biological process, but the physical symptoms, such as hot flushes, and emotional symptoms of menopause usually disrupt your sleep, lower your energy and / or affect emotional health. There‚Äôs many effective treatments available, from lifestyle adjustments to hormone therapy. However one of the symptoms of the menopause besides hot flushes, depression, anxiety and night sweats can often be lack of sleep. Is this you? Do you owe it to yourself to at least try a possible solution?

            ‚ÄúMy partner has practically snored every night of our relationship of about 15 years, and was gradually getting worse! He would wake in the morning, having a had a great nights sleep, but I would be completely wrecked through the lack of sleep! I was on the verge of sleeping on the sofa, but in conversation with a friend and this subject came up. She suggested the sleep mist from this website, well, I couldn‚Äôt believe it, from the very first night of using it and all it is, is a light spray / mist over you pillow, just before going to bed, well, we both slept so good, no snoring at all. Fantastic product. Well done to everyone at Sleep Better Pillow Mist.‚Äù

            ‚ÄúWhat a great sleeping aid this pillow mist is. I would sometimes find it difficult to go to sleep and then find myself waking up during the night. These essential oils work great, as long as I have nothing to eat or drink within one hour of going to bed, then spray this pillow mist lightly on the pillows, then that‚Äôs it, I go to sleep straight away, then sleeping all the way through till the morning. Thoroughly recommended to anyone who would like to sleep better.‚Äù

            ‚ÄúWe have been using the pillow spray for several years now and I really would not want to do without it. I started using it because my daughter slept very fitfully and frequently had night terrors and I didn‚Äôt know what to do. This sleep mist stopped her waking up in the night from the very first time she used it, which was amazing and I was very impressed. It really helps you breathe deeply before going to sleep, it smells very nice, not watery or overly sweet like some other pillow sprays I have tried and it even seems to make your dreams more vivid, which is fun! It‚Äôs great value and lasts for months. Five big fat stars.‚Äù

It‚Äôs great that it‚Äôs been helping yourself and your family to sleep better, especially the children, because, generally, if the children sleep good, the parents stand a good chance of sleeping good as well!
