            <strong>The majority of people may not be fully aware of fibromyalgia, but for those who do suffer with fibromyalgia, it‚Äôs very real.</strong> Fibromyalgia is a long-term condition that usually causes pain all over the body, which inevitably leads to major sleep issues.
            <br />
            <br />
            Fibromyalgia is often accompanied by other chronic pain conditions such as chronc fatigue syndrome and irritable bowel syndrome.
            <br />
            <br />
            The Sleep Better Pillow Mist available from this website has been known to help people who have sleep issues due to fibromyalgia.

              Whoever makes this sleep better pillow mist deserves a medal! My marriage was almost on the rocks with the amount of snoring my wife was doing during the night, and I didn‚Äôt want to sleep on the sofa, so we tried this, and it‚Äôs great, just one light spray on each corner of the pillow at night, a few minutes before going to bed and we get a great nights sleep. She still snores very occasionally, maybe once every couple of weeks, but nothing like it was, which was her snoring every night. A definite great result‚Äù

                Hi Tony, thank you very much for emailing in your review of the Sleep Better Pillow Mist, it‚Äôs really appreciated. Snoring can not only be a dreadful sleep problem, it can also break up relationships if one of the people involved snores, so it‚Äôs great that you took steps to solve it.

              I don‚Äôt usually do reviews, but this sleep better pillow mist from Sleep Better Pillow Mist is truly amazing. Just a couple of light sprays on the pillow at night and it helps you to relax immediately, then we go to sleep straight away. Has definitely helped us in the family to stop snoring and to stop waking up in the night. Has been used on the whole family from the very young to the adults. Great with kids and adults that have trouble sleeping! Totally recommended.

              ‚ÄúI have many debilitating conditions, including chronic anxiety, widespread Osteoarthritis and Fibromyalgia. As a result, I suffer from terrible Insomnia. After not having a good nights sleep for months, I desperately searched the internet and came across ‚ÄòSleep Better Pillow Mist‚Äô and although sceptical, I ordered a bottle of this ‚Äòso-called‚Äô magic potion. My reaction after trying it was ‚ÄòWOW!‚Äô. I simply sprayed the corners of my pillow, and the magical aromas of Lavender, Chamomile and Eucalyptus ensured I had slept like a Sloth. Seriously! Months later and it‚Äôs still working, and you just wake up more refreshed. My advice to anyone having any trouble sleeping, just give it a try. It certainly worked for me. Thoroughly recommended.‚Äù

Going by the many emails from happy customers, some of whom used to suffer from the conditions that you mention, like anxiety, fibromyalgia and insomnia, but when trying this Sleep Better Mist, those conditions are a lot more bearable and in some cases disappear completely. Until finding this unique Sleep Better Pillow Mist, a lot of them hadn‚Äôt had a good nights sleep in years!
