            <strong>The majority of people may not be fully aware of fibromyalgia, but for those who do suffer with fibromyalgia, it‚Äôs very real.</strong> Fibromyalgia is a long-term condition that usually causes pain all over the body, which inevitably leads to major sleep issues.
            <br />
            <br />
            Fibromyalgia is often accompanied by other chronic pain conditions such as chronc fatigue syndrome and irritable bowel syndrome.
            <br />
            <br />
            The Sleep Better Pillow Mist available from this website has been known to help people who have sleep issues due to fibromyalgia.

              ‚ÄúI received my first bottle of this sleep mist and have to say I
              was hooked from the first night. Just a quick spray to each corner
              of my pillow and I‚Äôm surrounded by the relaxing, destressing
              natural aromas. Not only does it smell amazing it clears the
              airways making it easier to breathe. I use it every night now for
              a calming, deep sleep. It just removes the stresses of the day.

              Hi Martin, thank you very much for taking the time to do such a
              great review of our popular Sleep Better Pillow Mist. It‚Äôs
              fantastic to keep seeing great feedback like yours for this
              product from our customers. It did take four years (from 2014 to
              2018) of hard work, focus and solid research into sleep problems
              and the potential sleep solutions, so it‚Äôs great to see that work
              now paying off for so many people.

            ‚ÄúMy partner and I absolutely love this sleep mist! It smells
            amazing, it‚Äôs long lasting (you can still smell it the next morning)
            and it doesn‚Äôt have that eye watering or throat irritating chemical
            effect of other brands that we have tried, so will be replacing our
            usual brand for this. Even our little one is lasting longer in his
            cot before waking up! (amazing achievement!) Extremely calming. We
            love it. Thanks! Can definitely recommend it to anyone and have
            already recommended this pillow mist to family, friends and
            colleagues!‚Äù
