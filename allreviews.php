            “I couldn’t recommend this product more highly (and I’m difficult to please!) Left to my own devices, I’d have been quite cynical about this sort of product and I do not expect I would have purchased it. Fortunately for me, my husband bought me this for Christmas as I have had difficulty getting some quality, unbroken sleep. I can honestly say that it has made a HUGE difference. The quality of my sleep is now vastly improved and I use this routinely. The smell is lovely and I now associate it with getting a great night’s sleep. I will certainly be a returning customer.”

I have loads of energy for the next day because I’ve slept good the night before. Friends and family are saying how much better I look because of it.

            “My 15 year old son has suffered with breathing problems since he was 3 months old. It has always impacted his sleep, he barely got 4 hours a night and nothing we tried was any help until we were told about this sleep better pillow mist, my son has now been using it for over a year now and he gets the best nights sleep he’s ever had, every night and if he forgets to spray his pillow and wakes up in the night, he just sprays (it doesn’t stain) onto his pillow and he’s back off to sleep again. I would recommend this to anyone that struggles with sleep, it’s an amazing product.”

            “We tried the product after using some some of the more commercial sleep products out there and we found that this was far more effective. The smell is stronger than other ones that we have used but creates a great aura before bed. We used it for my 5 year old and 2 year old and their sleep, especially during lockdown in the UK, has improved since using this product. The bottle will last us for ages which is great! It is a fantastic product that we didn’t even know we needed.”

My brother-in-law introduced me to this sleep better pillow mist, all I can say is, what an amazing product it is! From the very first night on using this mist, he hardly snored at all and has hardly snored at all since. We had a meal out a few days ago to celebrate!!

              Hello Olivia, thank you for taking the time to do such a great review on the Sleep Better Pillow Mist, it’s always appreciated. From the many emails received here at Sleep Better Pillow Mist HQ, this seems to be a recurring problem, with comments such as “My partner snores, how can I stop them from snoring” or “How can I sleep when my partner snores?” All we can say to those that are still not sure, is just try it!

              Hi Martin, thank you very much for taking the time to do such a

              fantastic to keep seeing great feedback like yours for this

              and the potential sleep solutions, so it’s great to see that work

            “My partner and I absolutely love this sleep mist! It smells
            amazing, it’s long lasting (you can still smell it the next morning)
            and it doesn’t have that eye watering or throat irritating chemical
            effect of other brands that we have tried, so will be replacing our
            usual brand for this. Even our little one is lasting longer in his
            cot before waking up! (amazing achievement!) Extremely calming. We
            love it. Thanks! Can definitely recommend it to anyone and have
            already recommended this pillow mist to family, friends and
            colleagues!”

              Hello Sandra, thank you for taking the time to email in those great comments for the Sleep Better Pillow Mist and it’s brilliant news that it’s helping your daughter to sleep better. Getting a good nights sleep is so important, but for growing children, this is when it’s critical, children only grow when they’re asleep, and if they don’t get as much sleep as other children, they will be at a disadvantage because of that.

              Hi Sim, thank you so much for this great feedback, it’s really appreciated. Yes, it does have many uses, apart from the main idea of lightly misting it on your pillow to help you sleep at night, you can also use it as a room spray, in your bath water, it also helps to keep mosquitoes away! Going by the many emails we receive on this, some people buy the Sleep Better Pillow Mist and spray around their lounge to help them relax in the evening after a hard days work!

              Whoever makes this sleep better pillow mist deserves a medal! My marriage was almost on the rocks with the amount of snoring my wife was doing during the night, and I didn’t want to sleep on the sofa, so we tried this, and it’s great, just one light spray on each corner of the pillow at night, a few minutes before going to bed and we get a great nights sleep. She still snores very occasionally, maybe once every couple of weeks, but nothing like it was, which was her snoring every night. A definite great result”

              I don’t usually do reviews, but this sleep better pillow mist from Sleep Better Pillow Mist is truly amazing. Just a couple of light sprays on the pillow at night and it helps you to relax immediately, then we go to sleep straight away. Has definitely helped us in the family to stop snoring and to stop waking up in the night. Has been used on the whole family from the very young to the adults. Great with kids and adults that have trouble sleeping! Totally recommended.

              “My 8 year old lad was having loads of sleep problems, it would take him ages to go to sleep, so in the morning, he was very tired and always did poorly at school because of this. My brother-in-law suggested I try this sleep better pillow mist on my lad, and it worked straight away, right from the very first night! Doesn’t contain any chemicals, just natural essential oils, so it ticks a lot of boxes. If you know someone who has sleep problems, just get this sleep better pillow mist for them.”

                Hello Jane, thank you for the great review of the Sleep Better Pillow Mist. In a lot of the emails we receive from parents, of school age children, a common them is that they say the child is now doing much better at school, because they’ve had a good nights sleep the night before, due to the Sleep Better Pillow Mist from this website. Please spread the word wherever you can.

              “I have many debilitating conditions, including chronic anxiety, widespread Osteoarthritis and Fibromyalgia. As a result, I suffer from terrible Insomnia. After not having a good nights sleep for months, I desperately searched the internet and came across ‘Sleep Better Pillow Mist’ and although sceptical, I ordered a bottle of this ‘so-called’ magic potion. My reaction after trying it was ‘WOW!’. I simply sprayed the corners of my pillow, and the magical aromas of Lavender, Chamomile and Eucalyptus ensured I had slept like a Sloth. Seriously! Months later and it’s still working, and you just wake up more refreshed. My advice to anyone having any trouble sleeping, just give it a try. It certainly worked for me. Thoroughly recommended.”

                Hello Darren, thank you for your feedback, it’s really appreciated. Going by the many emails from happy customers, some of whom used to suffer from the conditions that you mention, like anxiety, fibromyalgia and insomnia, but when trying this Sleep Better Mist, those conditions are a lot more bearable and in some cases disappear completely. Until finding this unique Sleep Better Pillow Mist, a lot of them hadn’t had a good nights sleep in years!

He would wake in the morning, having a had a great nights sleep, but I would be completely wrecked through the lack of sleep! I was on the verge of sleeping on the sofa, but in conversation with a friend and this subject came up. She suggested the sleep mist from this website, well, I couldn’t believe it, from the very first night of using it and all it is, is a light spray / mist over you pillow, just before going to bed, well, we both slept so good, no snoring at all.

            “We have been using the pillow spray for several years now and I really would not want to do without it. I started using it because my daughter slept very fitfully and frequently had night terrors and I didn’t know what to do. This sleep mist stopped her waking up in the night from the very first time she used it, which was amazing and I was very impressed. It really helps you breathe deeply before going to sleep, it smells very nice, not watery or overly sweet like some other pillow sprays I have tried and it even seems to make your dreams more vivid, which is fun! It’s great value and lasts for months. Five big fat stars.”

              Hi Ben, thank you very much for this great feedback on the popular Sleep Better Pillow Mist. It’s great that it’s been helping yourself and your family to sleep better, especially the children, because, generally, if the children sleep good, the parents stand a good chance of sleeping good as well! The current price is very reasonable and usually lasts at least 6 months, so excellent value. This price is in British Pounds, but we do send the Sleep Better Pillow Mist all over the world.

              Hi Graham, thank you for this great review of the Sleep Better Pillow Mist, it’s appreciated. Yes, not only can it help with snoring and insomnia, but it’s multi use as well, a pillow spray, a great smelling room spray, a brilliant relaxing few sprays in your bath water, it even keeps mosquitoes away when sprayed on your clothing when outside in the summer for example.

            “My daughter aged 10 was not sleeping good, then waking up really tired and not doing well at her school subjects. We were at our wits end, didn’t know what to do. A work colleague suggested that we try this sleep mist. We were a little wary about it at first, but there was no need to worry, just a light misted spray over my daughters pillow and and within less than 10 minutes, she was fast asleep, and didn’t wake up until the alarm clock went off. We are very impressed with the product and even bought my work colleague a small present as a thank you for introducing it to us. My daughters school reports were so much better from then on. In fact, one of the teachers commented to us at a school meeting, how much better the school work is now. Thanks to everyone at Sleep Better Pillow Mist.”

            “I usually have problems going to sleep at night, sometimes just lying awake for hours with what is called ‘racing mind’ syndrome, finding it really difficult to relax enough to go to sleep, then waking in the morning from alarm clock, but always feeling really tired!. My brother in law knew of my sleep issues and recommended this sleep better pillow mist, he explained that he had been using it successfully for two years and that it might be able to work for me. I order the mist from this website on the very first night of receiving it and using it, with the really great, relaxing fragrance, I got to sleep within about 10 minutes, slept all the way through the night, waking in the morning, completely ready for the day. Phenomenal product, for anyone reading this, if you’re not sleeping good and / or your waking up in the night, try this. Totally recommended.”
