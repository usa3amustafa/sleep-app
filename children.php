            <strong>There can be many and varied reasons for children to not sleep well at night.</strong> They might be hyperactive, they might have slept during the day and so are not so tired at night, there could be a noise issue, etc. The problem is, is that if your children don’t sleep well, then usually, nor do you!!

            “My daughter aged 10 was not sleeping good, then waking up really tired and not doing well at her school subjects. We were at our wits end, didn’t know what to do. A work colleague suggested that we try this sleep mist. We were a little wary about it at first, but there was no need to worry, just a light misted spray over my daughters pillow and and within less than 10 minutes, she was fast asleep, and didn’t wake up until the alarm clock went off. We are very impressed with the product and even bought my work colleague a small present as a thank you for introducing it to us. My daughters school reports were so much better from then on. In fact, one of the teachers commented to us at a school meeting, how much better the school work is now. Thanks to everyone at Sleep Better Pillow Mist.”

            “I usually have problems going to sleep at night, sometimes just lying awake for hours with what is called ‘racing mind’ syndrome, finding it really difficult to relax enough to go to sleep, then waking in the morning from alarm clock, but always feeling really tired!. My brother in law knew of my sleep issues and recommended this sleep better pillow mist, he explained that he had been using it successfully for two years and that it might be able to work for me. I order the mist from this website on the very first night of receiving it and using it, with the really great, relaxing fragrance, I got to sleep within about 10 minutes, slept all the way through the night, waking in the morning, completely ready for the day. Phenomenal product, for anyone reading this, if you’re not sleeping good and / or your waking up in the night, try this. Totally recommended.”

It has certainly made a lot of difference and I am falling asleep much more quickly now and if I wake up in the night, which still happens sometimes, I just lightly spray the mist on my pillow and seem to fall asleep again fairly soon. Would certainly recommend it.”
